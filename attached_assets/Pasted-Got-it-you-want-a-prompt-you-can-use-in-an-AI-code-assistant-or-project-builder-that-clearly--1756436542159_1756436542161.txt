üöÄ Prompt to Create the Medicinal Plant AI Project

"I want to build a complete open-source AI-powered project for medicinal plant identification and traditional knowledge sharing. The system should:

1. Core Functionality

Accept an uploaded image of a plant/leaf/part from a user.

Use CNN with transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet) to identify the medicinal plant.

Provide the user with details like plant name, medicinal uses, and remedies.



2. Interactive Voice Features

Convert the plant details into speech output using free/open-source TTS (e.g., gTTS, Coqui TTS).

Call or message the user via Asterisk PBX, FreeSWITCH, or Twilio alternative to speak the information.

Allow users to ask queries by voice; use an ASR tool (e.g., Whisper) to transcribe speech into text, then respond back with AI-generated speech.



3. Knowledge Contribution System

Enable local healers and community members to contribute plant knowledge via text or voice.

Use ASR for voice contributions, then store knowledge in a structured database.

Add a moderation workflow so contributions can be validated before publishing.

Build a knowledge base searchable by plant name, uses, or remedies.

Recognize contributors with badges or highlights to encourage participation.



4. Architecture & Tech Stack

Frontend (mobile/web): React or Flutter for mobile, HTML/CSS/JS or React for web.

Backend: Flask/Django or Node.js.

Database: SQLite/PostgreSQL (free + open-source).

ML/AI: PyTorch/TensorFlow for CNN + Whisper for ASR + gTTS/Coqui for TTS.

Hosting: Render / Railway / Heroku (free tier).

Containerization: Docker for portability.



5. Extra Features

Support for multilingual output (English + Indian regional languages).

Interactive WhatsApp bot integration using open-source libraries.

Ability to document unknown plants (if not identified, store the image + community discussion).

Build a structured digital medicinal plant repository accessible to all.



6. Project Scope

Problem: Lack of accessible, structured documentation of medicinal plants and their uses.

Solution: AI + community-driven knowledge sharing + free and open-source stack.

Impact: Helps preserve indigenous wisdom, provides affordable healthcare awareness, and empowers rural communities.

Future Scope: Expand to other biodiversity regions, integrate with IoT plant sensors, and add AR-based plant exploration.




Now, generate a complete system design, folder structure, and starter code implementation with step-by-step instructions for setting up this project using only free and open-source tools."

üëâ This single prompt will guide an AI coding tool (like me or GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) to scaffold the entire system for you.

Do you want me to adapt this prompt into a "step-by-step roadmap" (like Phase 1: dataset, Phase 2: model training, Phase 3: voice integration, etc.) so you can build it gradually?
